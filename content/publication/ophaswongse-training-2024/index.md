abstract: Individuals with neurological impairments and deficits in trunk control
  have difficulty maintaining and controlling upright postures during static or dynamic
  sitting. Passive devices may support the trunk in a wheelchair at the expense of
  the userâ€™s mobility, but opportunities for postural rehabilitation training may
  be compromised as a result. This paper presents novel seated postural training using
  a pelvic Wheelchair Robot for Active Postural Supports (pWRAPS) to improve upper
  body coordination. These tasks are performed within the pelvic range of motion (ROM)
  in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. We investigated the effects of active pelvic
  guidance on upper body coordination during reaching tasks in different directions.
  Sixteen able-bodied young adult volunteers were assigned to two groups (eight per
  group). The first group completed the VR task in transparent mode, i.e., without
  pWRAPS actively guiding the pelvis. The second group completed the same task while
  their pelvis was actively guided by pWRAPS. The results support our hypothesis that
  the group with active pelvic guidance is able to adjust their pelvic trajectory
  closer to the assigned target than the control group without active pWRAPS. Moreover,
  after training, the group with active pelvic guidance exhibits better hand-tracking
  and pelvic accuracy than the control group. This indicates that the actively guided
  subjects simultaneously adjust their upper body and pelvis movements towards their
  targeted trajectories. This new training approach can potentially be adapted to
  postural rehabilitation for wheelchair users with limited trunk control.
