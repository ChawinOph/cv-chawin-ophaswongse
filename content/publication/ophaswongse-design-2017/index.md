abstract: This paper proposes a novel methodology for the design of series elastic
  actuators in parallel-actuated platforms which have full six degrees-of-freedom
  in position and orientation. Series elastic actuators can potentially contribute
  to lower power consumption and provide a better human-machine interface for the
  user. This is an important consideration in the use of a robotic spine exoskeleton
  for human subjects, which motivates this work. In the study of parallel-actuated
  systems with full six degrees-offreedom, the effect of compliance in series with
  actuators has not been adequately studied from the perspective of kinematics and
  wrench capabilities. These analyses are performed in this paper with the goal to
  improve the design of the robotic spine exoskeleton (ROSE) and its human usage.
