abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a spinal curvature that affects
  3% of the population and disproportionately affects females. It is treated with
  bracing and many researchers are developing models of the torso to optimize the
  effectiveness of brace designs. Unfortunately, the data available to create these
  models is limited by the experimental methods employed. One method, in vitro spine
  cadaver stiffness measurements, is generally based on specimens from the elderly,
  which are not representative of the adolescent population. The other method, radiographic
  studies, can only provide a limited amount of information because of the radiation
  exposure that multiple images require. In this work, we present a Robotic Spine
  Exoskeleton (RoSE) tailored to the population in greatest need of AIS interventions–female
  adolescents. We use it to create a three-dimensional stiffness characterization
  of the torso in vivo for eight female adolescents with scoliosis and eight without
  this condition. The key ﬁndings include an interaction effect of DOF and torso segment
  on translational collinear stiffnesses, and an interaction effect of DOF and group
  on rotational collinear stiffnesses. We also found that the 3D coupling stiffness
  pattern is in line with that of the human spine, regardless of spinal deformity.
  Also, the magnitude of the torso stiffness for the tested population is less than
  that of the adult male population previously characterized. Our results provide
  quantitative data for torso stiffness and can be used to improve brace designs.
  Our methods could also be adapted as a way to customize subject-speciﬁc treatment
  methods, as there is a lot of variation among subjects.
