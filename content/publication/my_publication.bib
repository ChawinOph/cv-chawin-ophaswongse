    abstract = {Background: Hydraulic knee prosthesis can provide stance phase control and swing phase control suitable for active persons with an amputation. However, typical commercial hydraulic knees are costly and require frequent maintenance making them inaccessible for persons with an amputation in low-income countries. The objective of this article is to present a new design for a low-cost hydraulic knee prosthesis.
Method: The prototype hydraulic knee is made of simple hydraulic components. The hydraulic system was designed to provide flexion locking during the stance phase and damping during the swing phase of gait.
Results: The prototype was tested and results show that the hydraulic knee can prevent flexion of the knee at stance phase when the highest external knee flexion moment in the gait cycle occurs. The prototype mechanism is capable of resisting flexion torque of 60 N-m.
Conclusions: The prototype hydraulic knee can be assembled from available hydraulic components for low cost and ease of maintenance which is feasible for persons with an amputation in lowincome countries.},

    abstract = {Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a spinal curvature that affects 3\% of the population and disproportionately affects females. It is treated with bracing and many researchers are developing models of the torso to optimize the effectiveness of brace designs. Unfortunately, the data available to create these models is limited by the experimental methods employed. One method, in vitro spine cadaver stiffness measurements, is generally based on specimens from the elderly, which are not representative of the adolescent population. The other method, radiographic studies, can only provide a limited amount of information because of the radiation exposure that multiple images require. In this work, we present a Robotic Spine Exoskeleton (RoSE) tailored to the population in greatest need of AIS interventions–female adolescents. We use it to create a three-dimensional stiffness characterization of the torso in vivo for eight female adolescents with scoliosis and eight without this condition. The key ﬁndings include an interaction effect of DOF and torso segment on translational collinear stiffnesses, and an interaction effect of DOF and group on rotational collinear stiffnesses. We also found that the 3D coupling stiffness pattern is in line with that of the human spine, regardless of spinal deformity. Also, the magnitude of the torso stiffness for the tested population is less than that of the adult male population previously characterized. Our results provide quantitative data for torso stiffness and can be used to improve brace designs. Our methods could also be adapted as a way to customize subject-speciﬁc treatment methods, as there is a lot of variation among subjects.},

The WRAPS is a robotic exoskeleton that allows limited degrees-of-freedom of the trunk relative to the pelvis. There are three degrees-of-freedoms in the sagittal plane of the human body and one in lateral bending. The work is motivated by the needs of individuals with impaired trunk motor control, who currently rely on the use of passive and predominantly static supports to maintain a static posture. These devices can be overly restrictive and inhibit the user in their activities of daily living. The WRAPS is capable of supporting a human user within their active range of torso motion. It has the potential to assist users in their activities of daily living while encouraging a dynamic range of healthy postures.},

Passive devices like straps and orthoses may be used currently to support the trunk in a wheelchair at the expense of user mobility. Alternatively, we propose that an active support to the pelvic segment may enhance daily activities while maintaining stability on the seat. This paper presents a kinematic validation of a fabricated robotic device for pelvic assistance on a wheelchair, and we name this device as a pelvic Wheelchair Robot for Active Postural Support (pWRAPS). The robot has an in-parallel architecture with three rotational degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). The end-effector translation is also coupled with the rotation to accommodate the natural movement of the pelvis on the seat. The device was tested with seven healthy subjects to evaluate the workspace provided by the device compared to their natural range of motion (ROM). The position accuracy of the device was also validated against a virtual reality (VR) motion tracking system.},

    abstract = {Pelvis mobility is essential to the daily seated activities of wheelchair users, however it is not yet fully addressed in the ﬁeld of active wearable devices. This letter presents a novel design and optimization methodology of an in-parallel actuated robotic brace for assisting the human pelvis during seated maneuvers on wheelchair. This design uses human data captured by cameras in conjunction with the knowledge of kinematic geometry and screw theory. The mechanism has full rotational three degreesof-freedom (DOFs) and also accommodates coupled translation of the human pelvic segment. This type of motion was realized by employing three kinematic limbs that impose non-intersecting zeropitch constraint wrenches on the platform. Our multi-objective optimization (MOO) routine consists of two stages: (I) platform constraint synthesis, where the geometric parameters of the limb constraints were determined to minimize the pelvis-platform errors of trajectories and instantaneous screw axes (ISAs); and (II) limb structural synthesis, where limb types and dimensions, workspace, transmission performances, singularities, and actuated joint displacements were considered. The optimized mechanism has an asymmetrical [RRR]U-2[RR]S architecture. This mechanism can also be integrated into our previously developed Wheelchair Robot for Active Postural Support (WRAPS).},

    abstract = {Individuals with neurological impairments and deficits in trunk control have difficulty maintaining and controlling upright postures during static or dynamic sitting. Passive devices may support the trunk in a wheelchair at the expense of the user’s mobility, but opportunities for postural rehabilitation training may be compromised as a result. This paper presents novel seated postural training using a pelvic Wheelchair Robot for Active Postural Supports (pWRAPS) to improve upper body coordination. These tasks are performed within the pelvic range of motion (ROM) in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. We investigated the effects of active pelvic guidance on upper body coordination during reaching tasks in different directions. Sixteen able-bodied young adult volunteers were assigned to two groups (eight per group). The first group completed the VR task in transparent mode, i.e., without pWRAPS actively guiding the pelvis. The second group completed the same task while their pelvis was actively guided by pWRAPS. The results support our hypothesis that the group with active pelvic guidance is able to adjust their pelvic trajectory closer to the assigned target than the control group without active pWRAPS. Moreover, after training, the group with active pelvic guidance exhibits better hand-tracking and pelvic accuracy than the control group. This indicates that the actively guided subjects simultaneously adjust their upper body and pelvis movements towards their targeted trajectories. This new training approach can potentially be adapted to postural rehabilitation for wheelchair users with limited trunk control.},
