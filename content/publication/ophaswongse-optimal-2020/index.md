abstract: 'Pelvis mobility is essential to the daily seated activities of wheelchair
  users, however it is not yet fully addressed in the Ô¨Åeld of active wearable devices.
  This letter presents a novel design and optimization methodology of an in-parallel
  actuated robotic brace for assisting the human pelvis during seated maneuvers on
  wheelchair. This design uses human data captured by cameras in conjunction with
  the knowledge of kinematic geometry and screw theory. The mechanism has full rotational
  three degreesof-freedom (DOFs) and also accommodates coupled translation of the
  human pelvic segment. This type of motion was realized by employing three kinematic
  limbs that impose non-intersecting zeropitch constraint wrenches on the platform.
  Our multi-objective optimization (MOO) routine consists of two stages: (I) platform
  constraint synthesis, where the geometric parameters of the limb constraints were
  determined to minimize the pelvis-platform errors of trajectories and instantaneous
  screw axes (ISAs); and (II) limb structural synthesis, where limb types and dimensions,
  workspace, transmission performances, singularities, and actuated joint displacements
  were considered. The optimized mechanism has an asymmetrical [RRR]U-2[RR]S architecture.
  This mechanism can also be integrated into our previously developed Wheelchair Robot
  for Active Postural Support (WRAPS).'
