abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing linear series elastic actuators
  (SEAs) in a parallel-actuated Stewart platform, which has full six degrees-of-freedom
  (DOF) in position and orientation. SEAs can potentially provide a better humanâ€“machine
  interface for the user. However, in the study of parallel-actuated systems with
  full 6DOF, the effect of compliance in series with actuators has not been adequately
  studied from the perspective of wrench capabilities. We found that some parameters
  of the springs and the stroke lengths of the linear actuators play a major role
  in the actuation limits of the system. This is an important consideration when adding
  SEAs into a Stewart platform or other parallel-actuated robots to improve their
  human usage.
