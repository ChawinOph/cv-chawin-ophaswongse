abstract: This paper describes the design and control architecture of a novel wheelchair-mounted
  robot for active postural support (WRAPS). The WRAPS is a robotic exoskeleton that
  allows limited degrees-of-freedom of the trunk relative to the pelvis. There are
  three degrees-of-freedoms in the sagittal plane of the human body and one in lateral
  bending. The work is motivated by the needs of individuals with impaired trunk motor
  control, who currently rely on the use of passive and predominantly static supports
  to maintain a static posture. These devices can be overly restrictive and inhibit
  the user in their activities of daily living. The WRAPS is capable of supporting
  a human user within their active range of torso motion. It has the potential to
  assist users in their activities of daily living while encouraging a dynamic range
  of healthy postures.
