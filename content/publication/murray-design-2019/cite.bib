 abstract = {This paper describes the design and control architecture of a novel wheelchair-mounted robot for active postural support (WRAPS). The WRAPS is a robotic exoskeleton that allows limited degrees-of-freedom of the trunk relative to the pelvis. There are three degrees-of-freedoms in the sagittal plane of the human body and one in lateral bending. The work is motivated by the needs of individuals with impaired trunk motor control, who currently rely on the use of passive and predominantly static supports to maintain a static posture. These devices can be overly restrictive and inhibit the user in their activities of daily living. The WRAPS is capable of supporting a human user within their active range of torso motion. It has the potential to assist users in their activities of daily living while encouraging a dynamic range of healthy postures.},
