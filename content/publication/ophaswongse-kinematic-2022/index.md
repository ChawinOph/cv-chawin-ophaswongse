abstract: Individuals with severe impairments in trunk control have difÔ¨Åculty maintaining
  and controlling upright posture during static or dynamic sitting. Passive devices
  like straps and orthoses may be used currently to support the trunk in a wheelchair
  at the expense of user mobility. Alternatively, we propose that an active support
  to the pelvic segment may enhance daily activities while maintaining stability on
  the seat. This paper presents a kinematic validation of a fabricated robotic device
  for pelvic assistance on a wheelchair, and we name this device as a pelvic Wheelchair
  Robot for Active Postural Support (pWRAPS). The robot has an in-parallel architecture
  with three rotational degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). The end-effector translation is
  also coupled with the rotation to accommodate the natural movement of the pelvis
  on the seat. The device was tested with seven healthy subjects to evaluate the workspace
  provided by the device compared to their natural range of motion (ROM). The position
  accuracy of the device was also validated against a virtual reality (VR) motion
  tracking system.
