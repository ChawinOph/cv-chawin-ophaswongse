abstract: 'Background: Hydraulic knee prosthesis can provide stance phase control
  and swing phase control suitable for active persons with an amputation. However,
  typical commercial hydraulic knees are costly and require frequent maintenance making
  them inaccessible for persons with an amputation in low-income countries. The objective
  of this article is to present a new design for a low-cost hydraulic knee prosthesis.
  Method: The prototype hydraulic knee is made of simple hydraulic components. The
  hydraulic system was designed to provide flexion locking during the stance phase
  and damping during the swing phase of gait. Results: The prototype was tested and
  results show that the hydraulic knee can prevent flexion of the knee at stance phase
  when the highest external knee flexion moment in the gait cycle occurs. The prototype
  mechanism is capable of resisting flexion torque of 60 N-m. Conclusions: The prototype
  hydraulic knee can be assembled from available hydraulic components for low cost
  and ease of maintenance which is feasible for persons with an amputation in lowincome
  countries.'
