abstract: People with severe neuromuscular trunk impairment cannot maintain or control
  upright posture of the upper body in sitting while reaching. Passive orthoses are
  clinically available to provide support and promote the use of upper extremities
  in this population. However, these orthoses only position the torso passively without
  any degree of trunk movement.
